# City Explorer

**Author**: Jacob Bassett
**Version**: 1.0.0 

## Overview

This website will allow users to search for US cities and receive a map icon of that city.

## Getting Started

<!-- What are the steps that a user must take in order to build this app on their own machine and get it running? -->

## Architecture

![Lab06 Wireframe](./public/images/lab06_wireframe.png)
 * This wireframe is a plan how the REST requests will work between the locationIQ API and our frontend app.
 * Made with Lacey

## Change Log

<!-- Use this area to document the iterative changes made to your application as each feature is successfully implemented. Use time stamps. Here's an example:

01-01-2001 4:59pm - Application now has a fully-functional express server, with a GET route for the location resource. -->
